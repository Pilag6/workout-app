# Pila Workout App


🏋️‍♂️ I built my own workout app — because I hate going to the gym.

I prefer working out at home or outdoors, just me, two dumbbells, and my bodyweight. So I decided to create a simple app to motivate myself — and now I’m actually sticking to it.


Here’s what the app does (so far):

✅ Includes (for now) 86 exercises for legs, chest, shoulders, triceps, biceps, abs, and back

 ✅ Lets me pick which muscle group I want to train each day

 ✅ I can set how many exercises I want, generate them randomly or manually, and reorder them before I start

 ✅ Each exercise has a short description and a video tutorial

 ✅ I can edit reps for each exercise and track my progress as I go

 ✅ After each set, there’s a 1-minute rest timer with a nice little animation (you can skip it too)

 ✅ Everything runs locally — data is saved in localStorage and I can export workouts as JSON to reuse them later



I built this for myself, but maybe it can help someone else too. That’s why I’m making it open source — feel free to use it, modify it, or just get inspired to move your body a bit more.
